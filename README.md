# MERN-memories-server
This is the back end of a MERN stack project I made with the tutorial videos from JavaScript Mastery on YouTube: https://youtu.be/aibtHnbeuio. Back end is deployed on Heroku, front end on Netlify and the project can be viewed at https://nthw-memories.netlify.app/ (no authentication added so feel free to add your own posts, just be nice!)
